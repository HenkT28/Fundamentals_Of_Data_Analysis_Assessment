# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assessment 2019

This repository contains all my work in regards to my Assessment 2019 for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis.

To access the repository, please go through below instructions:

1). Go to Github web site - User Account: HenkT28

2). Then go to Repositories, and select Fundamentals_Of_Data_Analysis_Assessment. Alternatively go to "Clone or download" drop down menu and copy below url:

<https://github.com/HenkT28/Fundamentals_Of_Data_Analysis_Assessment.git>

Then open up cmder (see futher below for download instructions) and run below command to clone the repository locally on your machine:

* git clone <https://github.com/HenkT28/Fundamentals_Of_Data_Analysis_Assessment.git> (remove the <> before running the git clone command)

## Problem statement

This assessment concerns the well-known tips [6] dataset and the Python [1] packages seaborn [5] and jupyter [4]. The project is broken into three parts, as follows:

Description:

* Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment.
* Within the repository, create a jupyter [4] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips [6] dataset. This part is worth 30% of your overall mark.

Regression:

* To the above jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount, and this part is also worth 30%.

Analyse:

* Again using the same notebook, analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish — for example, you may analyse all pairs of variables, or select a subset and analyse those.

## Installing Cmder and Ananconda (which includes Seaborn, Jupyter), and HowTo run Jupyter

* To install Seaborn [7] on your local machine, I would advise you to download the anaconda package distribution [8], which installs python [9] and other important python libraries including NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib (useful for machine learning).

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

Anaconda supports Windows, Mac and Linux.

<https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>

<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/>

Anaconda® is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python/R data science distribution, and a collection of over 1,500+ open source packages. Anaconda is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.
Anaconda3 includes Python 3.7.

* The Jupyter Notebook [4] is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

I'll be using Jupyter Notebook not Jupyter Lab in this assignment (see below the difference between the 2 interfaces):

-> Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebooks documents. It supports several languages like Python (IPython), Julia, R etc, and is largely used for data analysis, data visualization and further interactive, exploratory computing.

-> JupyterLab is a popular 'new' interface for working with Jupyter Notebooks. It is an interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code and data — and hence extremely extensible.

* Cmder is a software package which provides a nice command line interface on Windows [10].

I use Cmder for changing the working directory on my local machine, i.e. Fundamentals_Of_Data_Analysis_Assessment, from there I launch "jupyter notebook" command, and make changes to it.
