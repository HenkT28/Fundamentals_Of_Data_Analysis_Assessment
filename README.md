# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assessment 2019

This repository contains all my work in regards to my Assessment 2019 for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis.

by Henk Tjalsma

This assessment concerns the well-known tips [6] dataset and the Python [1] packages seaborn [5] and jupyter [4]. The project is broken into three parts, as follows:

Description:

* Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. 
* Within the repository, create a jupyter [4] notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips [6] dataset. This part is worth 30% of your overall mark.

Regression:

* To the above jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount, and this part is also worth 30%.

Analyse:

* Again using the same notebook, analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish â€” for example, you may analyse all pairs of variables, or select a subset and analyse those.
